## Cool or wierd seeds i found whilst testing

- 1208112345 - usual starting seed for testing purposes
- 0822262565 - snake
- 4310582139 - buggy map
- 4942**20**45542 - nonstandard map with complexity 20, might play around with that idea
- 4714**8**86210 - same thing, complexity 8
- 925355714 - decided to **for now** switch complexity from 1-5 to 1-9, as it works better with the current generator
